# gmacs

Greg's Emacs configuration.

This is my personal emacs configuration - constructed as a literate org file for Emacs 26.x.
I use this on both Mac OS and Ubuntu flavored Linux - YMMV.  This is an ongoing, work in progress
as I adapt to changes in my workflow.

I use Org-mode from git and the Microsoft LSP server for Python.  I'm migrating off Mac OS so that may
change back to Elpy if I can't get the server to run on Linux (I have not tried yet).
