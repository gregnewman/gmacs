# gmacs

Greg's Emacs configuration.

This is my personal emacs configuration - constructed as a literate org file for Emacs 26.x.
I use this on Ubuntu flavored Linux on multiple machines - YMMV.  This is an ongoing, work in progress
as I adapt to changes in my workflow.  I use Org-mode from git and the Microsoft LSP server for Python.
